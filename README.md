# Causal feedbacks in ecology and evolution

This repository contains the data and code necessary to replicate the analyses in "Towards a causal understanding of bidirectional effects in ecology and evolution". Note that all analyses have been organized using the targets package (see https://books.ropensci.org/targets/). Please feel free to contact me (sam.walmsley@dal.ca) if you have any questions about these data or analyses. 

## A note on executing code

All analyses can be replicated in a single step using the tar_make() function from the *targets* package. Specific outputs can then be examined using tar_read(*target-name-of-interest*).
