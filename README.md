# Causal feedbacks in ecology and evolution

This repository contains the data and code necessary to replicate the analyses in "Towards a causal understanding of bidirectional effects in ecology and evolution". Note that all analyses have been organized using the targets package (see https://books.ropensci.org/targets/).

## Worked examples

Method 1. Cross lagged effects: [Link to Vignette](https://github.com/swalmsley/Causal-Feedbacks-EEB/blob/main/Vignettes/Vignette-DiscreteTime_github.md)

Method 2. Continuous time methods: [Link to Vignette](https://github.com/swalmsley/Causal-Feedbacks-EEB/blob/main/Vignettes/Vignette-ContinuousTime_github.md)

Method 3. Instrumental Variables: [Link to Vignette](https://github.com/swalmsley/Causal-Feedbacks-EEB/blob/main/Vignettes/Vignette-InstrumentalVariables_github.md)
